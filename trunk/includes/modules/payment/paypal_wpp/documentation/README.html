                  This payment module works with PayPal's Website Payments Pro credit card gateway and is FULLY COMPLIANT with their rules.  This was developed on a stock 2.2ms2 install.
                  <br/><br/>
                  <b>Please note:</b> Due to Paypal's rule about express checkout being integrated with direct payment, this contribution is not trivial to install.  I've made this as simple to install as possible, but it requires a minimal level of PHP scripting knowledge.
                  <br/><br/>
                  <center><b><u>This package will modify your store in the following ways</u></b></center>
                  -If a logged in customer clicks on "Checkout," they're taken to the shipping page with a "Paypal Express Checkout" button at the top.  If they click on the "Express Checkout" button, they'll be taken to Paypal where they'll choose a shipping address and payment method, then be sent back to the checkout shipping page to choose a shipping method.  From there, depending on your settings, it'll either go to checkout payment hiding the other payment options but displaying other modules, like CCGV, or to checkout confirmation to complete the order.  
                  <br/><br/>
                  -If a visitor without an account, or someone who isn't logged in, clicks on "Checkout," they'll be taken to the login page where there are now three boxes.  They can either use express pay, create an account, or login.  If they use express pay, they'll be taken to Paypal where they'll choose a shipping address, then be sent back following the process above.  If they're not a current customer, based on the information returned from Paypal, an account will automatically be created for them and the account details emailed to their email address (notification is optional).  If they're an existing customer, they'll be logged in and their order will be added to their account.
                  <br/><br/>
                  -If they log in, or create an account, and go through the normal checkout process, then they can type in their credit card numbers and the direct payment API will charge their card transparently.
                  <br/><br/>
                  <b>!!WARNING!! IF YOU REMOVE THE EXPRESS CHECKOUT BUTTON FROM YOUR CART, YOU ARE VIOLATING PAYPAL'S TOS AND THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO DISALLOW ACCESS TO DIRECT PAYMENT AND/OR CLOSE YOUR ACCOUNT.  THIS CONTRIBUTION, AS DOWNLOADED, IS FULLY COMPLIANT WITH THEIR RULES.</b>

                  I've uploaded the pear modules you'll need in two separate packages in case you don't want, or can't, install them on your server using pear.

                  For full disclosure, you should know that I have modified one file because the payment module would timeout otherwise.  In the file:<br/>
                  /catalog/pear/Services/PayPal/SOAP/Transport/HTTP.php
                  <br/><br/>
                  I've modifed line 62 from:
                  <br/><br/>
                  var $timeout = 4;
                  <br/><br/>
                  to 
                  <br/><br/>
                  var $timeout = 300;
                  <br/><br/>
                  If you have a healthy paranoia and don't want to install the pear modules I've uploaded, you need to use pear to install the following packages (if they're not already installed):
                  Net_URL
                  Net_Socket
                  HTTP_Request
                  Log
                  <br/><br/>
                  You'll also need to download PayPal's Website Payments Pro 2.0 SDK and install the pear module contained within.  I suggest you change that timeout variable mentioned above, though.  A complex set of API calls over an encrypted connection needs more than 4 seconds to complete.  You should set this to at least 120.

                  0. BACKUP YOUR DATABASE AND ALL OF YOUR FILES!
                  <br/><br/>
                  1. You need an API certificate, API username, and API password.  Assuming you've already requested and been approved for Website Payments Pro direct payments, do this:
                  <br/><br/>
                  	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Goto My Account -> Profile.<br/>
                  	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Click the API Access link.<br/>
                  	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. Click the API Certificate Request link.<br/>
                  	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d. Complete the certificate request.<br/>
                  	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e. Click on download and save the file to your computer.<br/>
                  <br/><br/>
                  2. Copy the pear modules that you downloaded above into your /catalog/ directory so that they are located in /catalog/pear/
                  <br/><br/><br/>
                  3. Copy all of the files and directories from this zip file to your catalog directory keeping true to the directory structure.  For the files that already exist, you will need to either overwrite them, or manually update them by opening each one and copying the code between these tags:
                  <br/><br/>
                  //---PayPal WPP Modification START ---//<br/>
                  //---PayPal WPP Modification END ---//
                  <br/><br/><br/>
                  4. Import the included SQL file called "paypal_wpp.sql" into your database.  (Using phpMyAdmin)
                  <br/><br/><br/>
                  5. Upload the API certificate you downloaded from Paypal to:
                  /catalog/includes/modules/payment/wpp_cert/
                  <br/><br/>
                  For security, I have included a .htaccess file that denies access to any file put in there (DO NOT FORGET TO UPLOAD IT), so don't worry about anyone downloading it.  As of 0.3, you can store your certificate anywhere you want.  Simply type in the full path in the module's admin panel.
                  <br/><br/><br/>
                  6. Go into your Administration section -> Modules -> Payment and enable the "PayPal Direct Payment & Express Checkout" module.
                  <br/><br/><br/>
                  7. Fill in your API username, password, and the filename of your API certificate that you just uploaded and change the other settings.
                  <br/><br/><br/>
                  8. Click "Update" and you're done.  Assuming everything's installed properly, and the planets are aligned correctly, it should start processing your cards automagically.

                  <b>A:</b> Either your API username or password are wrong, your certificate is FUBAR'd, or you didn't install the pear modules correctly.  You can also try increasing the timeout in pear/Services/PayPal/SOAP/Transport/HTTP.php
                  <br/><br/>

                  <b>A:</b> PayPal will not return a customer's personal information to a non-https URL.  Fix your OSC configuration and install an SSL certificate if necessary, then try again.
                  <br/><br/>
                  <b>Q: It's declining all of my transactions and giving a 105xx error!</b><br/>
                  <b>A:</b> Only PayPal can help you there.  They're declining the cards probably because you don't have Direct Payment completely setup under your account.  Contact PayPal for assistance with this error.
                  <br/><br/>
                  <b>Q: It's declining transactions and giving a 10417 error!</b><br/>
                  <b>A:</b> This means that the customer doesn't have enough money in their bank or on their credit card to pay for this purchase.  Most of the time, Paypal is incorrect so you need to contact PayPal and ask them about it.
                  <br/><br/>
                  <b>Q: PayPal's only accepting ~60% of all credit card transactions.  Is this a bug in your module?</b><br/>
                  <b>A:</b> No, this this module submits information as the customer has entered it and their card getting declined is a combination of bad personal information and PayPal's servers.  It has been noted that PayPal has a low acceptance rate even when the information is correct, but YMMV.
                  <br/><br/>
                  <b>Q: Why do my international customers' cards get declined?</b><br/>
                  <b>A:</b> PayPal is a US-only processor.  While I've made changes to the module so that it will accept some international cards, it's not perfect.  If you expect to have many international (non-US) customers, I suggest you go with a traditional merchant account/gateway.
                  <br/><br/>
                  <b>Q: When the customer returns from PayPal after selecting "Express Checkout", only their name is returned.</b><br/>
                  <b>A:</b> PayPal will not return a customer's personal information to a non-https URL.  Fix your OSC configuration and install an SSL certificate if necessary, then try again.
                  <br/><br/>
                  <b>Q: I get a "(2030) Unable to find API certificate file" error!</b><br/>
                  <b>A:</b> Make sure that you:<br/>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A) Download the certificate you receive from Paypal and put it inside of the<br/>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/catalog/includes/modules/payment/wpp_cert/ directory<br/>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B) Ensure the path set to that directory is correct in the module's admin settings
                  <br/><br/>
                  <b>Q: The ec_process.php/checkout_confirmation.php/whatever.php comes up blank!</b><br/>
                  <b>A:</b> 99% of the time either your certificate is not installed with the module set to it or all your pear modules aren't installed.  Check your error_log file for details.
